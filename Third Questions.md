## ðŸŸ¢ **General Questions about Binary Files**

### a) What are the advantages of Binary Files?

- Faster read/write operations compared to text files.
    
- Less memory/storage usage as data is stored in raw format.
    
- Supports random access using file pointers.
    
- Suitable for storing structured data like objects and records.
    

### b) What are the differences between Text and Binary Files?

|Feature|Text Files|Binary Files|
|---|---|---|
|Format|Human-readable|Machine-readable|
|Size|Larger|Smaller|
|Processing|Slower|Faster|
|Editing|Editable with text editors|Not readable or editable with normal editors|
|Use Case|For documents and readable data|For structured data like records, media|

## ðŸŸ¦ **Parts Data Handling**

**Given**: Text file `PartData.txt` contains data in the following format:  
`PartNo PartName Marks10 Quantity Description`

### Tasks:

1. Create a **binary file** `Part.dat` that reads from `PartData.txt`.
    
2. Read and output the data from `Part.dat`.
    
3. Move the **get pointer** to Byte No. 100 from the beginning of the file.
    
4. Move the **put pointer** to the **end** of the file.

## ðŸŸ© **Student Data - Random Access Binary File**

**Given**: Text file `students.txt` contains data:  
`ID FirstName LastName GPA`

### Tasks:

1. Create a **random access binary file** `students.dat` so that each student's data is written at the location specified by their **ID**.
    
2. Read and output all the data from `students.dat`.
    
3. Output the data of a **certain student** using their ID.
    
4. **Update** the **GPA** of a certain student using their ID.
    
5. Output the **size** of the file `students.dat`.
