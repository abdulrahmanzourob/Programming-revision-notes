### True or False Statements
Mark the following statements as true or false. If false, explain why

1. Sequential Search is inefficient for large lists.  

2. Write function transfers a given number of bytes from main memory to a file.  

3. `fstream` may be used for both input and output streams. (Marks: 15)  

4. `fstream` may be used only for input.  

5. When specifying a file at runtime, the argument to the function `open` must be a C-string.  

6. Random file access is associated with a file pointer.  

7. File pointer is different from the pointers we have used in arrays.  

8. By default, a file is opened as a text file.  

9. Binary file access is faster and more compact than text file access.  

10. Data in a text file is called formatted data, while in a binary file it is called raw data.  

11. The one place C++ allows aggregate operations on arrays is the I/O of C-strings.  

12. C-string is a one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character `'\0'`.  

13. `getline()` function discards the terminating character.  

14. `>>` cannot be used to read strings that contain blanks.  

15. Null character is less than any other character in the `char` data set. 

16. When a function calls itself, a new copy of that function is run.  

17. Every recursive definition must have one (or more) base cases.  

18. Every recursive definition must have only one base case.  

19. The base case for which an answer is explicitly known can be stated non-recursively.  

20. The base case for which an answer is explicitly known can be stated recursively.  

21. A binary search of a list assumes that the list is sorted.
