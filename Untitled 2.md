A) There are two ways to solve a particular problem, iteration and recursion. a) Define a Recursion. b) What is the difference between iteration and recursion? c) What is meant by Infinite Recursion? d) Mention the Guides when writing Recursive Functions. e) What are the demerits of Recursive techniques? B) Write a function to multiply two numbers without * operator a) Using an iterative solution (looping) b) Using a recursive solution C) Write a recursive function that finds a largest element in an array whose prototype is: int largest(const int list[], int lowerIndex, int upperIndex). D) Convert this recursive function into a non-recursive one bool ValueInList(int list[], int searchItem, int startIndex, int length){ if (list[startIndex] == value) { cout << "Found at index: " << startIndex << endl; return true; } // Base case 1 else if (startIndex > length-1) return false; // Base case 2 else return ValueInList(list, value, startIndex + 1, length); }




A) There are two ways to solve a particular problem, iteration and recursion. a) Define a Recursion . b) What are the differences between iteration and recursion? c) What is meant by Infinite Recursion? d) Mention the Guides when writing Recursive Functions. B) Write a Boolean recursive function that search for a value in list whose prototype is: bool ValueInList(int list[], int value, int startIndex, int length) C) Convert the following recursive function into a non-recursive one void ReverseArray(int A[], int start, int end) { if (start < end) { swap(A[start],A[end]) ; ReverseArray(A, start + 1, end – 1); }}

A) There are two ways to solve a particular problem, iteration and recursion. a) What are the differences between iteration and recursion? b) What are the demerits of Recursive techniques ? c) Mention the Guides when writing Recursive Functions. B) Write a recursive function that sums the elements of an Array Recursively whose prototype is: int Sum(A,n) where, A is the array name and n is the number of elements. C) Convert the following recursive function into a non-recursive one void ReverseArray(int A[], int start, int end) { if (start < end) { swap(A[start],A[end]) ; ReverseArray(A, start + 1, end – 1); }} D) State the differences between the two versions of iterative and recursive Factorial functions with respect to: 1) the used construct 2) the used variables End of Exam Good Luck Dr.Mahmoud M.Isamil 3) initialization
